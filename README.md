# siim-reference-model

This is just a reference model for the SIIM Pneumothorax Segmentation competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation). 
The directories referenced in the code below are pointing to a very small sample of the training and test sets. Therefore, this kernel, as is, will not yield a good result. This is intended to be a framework, so you should expect to have to replace those directories with the actual train & test sets, once you've retrieved them from https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/siim/SIIM%20Cloud%20Healthcare%20API%20Documentation.pdf
